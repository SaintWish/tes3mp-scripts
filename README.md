# tes3mp-scripts
Some random TES3MP scripts I worked on for a TES3MP server once upon a time. Some of the code is modified and some of it is written by me, idk which is which since it's been a while. 

## Maintence
Keep in mind this code may be broken and I have no intention of maintaining it so feel free to fork it or do pull requests.

## Server Initialization
If you use the serverInit script, it's recommended you load that script first the normal than add the rest of the scripts to a JSON file called ``scripts.json`` in via JSON directory. This will handle the loading of the scripts now.

## Pull Requests
Feel free to make pull requests and I'll get to them when I have time.
